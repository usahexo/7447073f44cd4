#  One of the Funniest Bingo Names in the U.S.2. What's In a Name? Ohio's Bingo is a Lot of Fun!

Ohioans love their bingo, and the winner of the funniest bingo name in the United States is Ohio's very own Bingo!

This tiny eastern Ohio town takes its bingo seriously, with six nights a week of games at the local fire hall. The town's name even lends itself to some hilarious bingo lingo: "B-17" is called when someone gets three of a kind in the 17th column on their card, for example.

According to local legend, the town's name dates back to the 1920s, when an itinerant preacher stopped in town for a break and decided to preach a sermon. He started by asking for a volunteer from the audience, and a man named Bingo stood up. The preacher was so amused that he decided to christen the town Bingo.

The rest, as they say, is history! Today, this small town of just over 1,000 residents is known far and wide for its love of bingo. In fact, many people travel from all over the state to play at the local hall.

So if you're ever in eastern Ohio, be sure to stop in Bingo and try your luck at some serious bingo action! You might just end up with one of the funniest names in U.S. history!

# 3. Ohio's Bingo Named After Game Played in English Saloons

In 1931, the first bingo game in Ohio was held. However, this type of bingo was not played like the one we know today. It was actually based on a game that was popular in English saloons during the 1800s. This earlier version of the game used cards with pictures of items instead of numbers.

Players would take turns calling out items and trying to match them with those that were on their cards. The first player to get a match would then yell "BINGO!" and claim the prize.

The game eventually evolved into the version that we play today, which uses numbered cards and matches players' numbers to those that are drawn from a container.

# 4. How Bingo Came to Be Named After the State of Ohio

Bingo is a classic game that is usually enjoyed by people of all ages. The game is said to have originated from Italy, where it was known as Beano. However, the game’s true origin is still a mystery. What we do know is that the modern form of bingo was created in the 1930s, and it quickly became popular in the United States.

One of the reasons why bingo became so popular in the US is because it was often played in churches as a fundraiser. In fact, the first recorded bingo game in the US was actually held at St. Peter’s Church in Philadelphia in 1935. In 1937, the state of Ohio decided to name bingo after itself, and the game soon became known as “Ohio Bingo”.

One of the main reasons why Ohio Bingo became so popular is because players could win real money prizes. In fact, in some cases, players could win more money than they spent on cards! This helped to increase attendance at bingo games, and soon enough, Ohio Bingo was being played in churches and schools all across the state.
