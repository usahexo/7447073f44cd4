Whether it’s a trip to the casino, placing a bet with a friend, or playing the state lottery, for some people gambling can be a fun and exciting pastime. For others, however, gambling can become a problem.</p>
<p>If you find that you are unable to resist the temptation to gamble, or that gambling is causing major problems in your life, there is help available. Here are twelve tips to help you overcome a gambling problem:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Admit that you have a problem and seek help. Many people who struggle with gambling deny that they have a problem or try to hide their addiction. This only makes things worse. Admitting that you have a problem and seeking help is the first step on the road to recovery.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Talk to someone who understands what you are going through. There are many organizations and support groups out there made specifically for people struggling with gambling addiction. Talking to someone who has been through it all before can be very helpful.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make a plan to avoid temptation. If you know you are going to be in a situation where gambling is likely (like at a casino), make sure you have a plan in place beforehand to avoid temptation. This might mean having someone accompany you who can keep an eye on your spending, or leaving your credit cards at home.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be honest about your finances. Gambling can quickly lead to financial problems if not managed properly. If you are having trouble keeping track of your spending, ask someone else to help you keep tabs on it – whether it’s a spouse, family member, or friend.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Avoid isolated situations where gambling is possible. When possible, try not to gamble alone – this increases the risk of developing an addiction. Gambling with friends or family can make it more social and enjoyable, which can reduce the risk of developing problems later on down the line.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Set limits on how much money you are willing to gamble each day&#x2F;week&#x2F;month etc. When money starts becoming an issue, it is easy for gambling to spiral out of control very quickly. Setting limits on how much money you are willing to gamble each time will help prevent this from happening .</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay away from “high-risk” gambles whenever possible Don’t put yourself in situations where winning big money is possible – this almost always leads to disaster in the long run for those with a gambling addiction. Stick to games where the odds are more in your favour instead (like roulette or blackjack).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>8} Don’t drink or use drugs when gambling . Alcohol and drugs often cloud judgement and make it harder to resist temptation – something no one struggling with a gambling problem needs! </p>
<p>9} Take breaks from gambling regularly . If you find yourself getting wrapped up in games for hours on end without stopping, take a break! Go outside for some fresh air, watch TV, read – just do anything other than gamble!<br>10} Be aware of warning signs that your gambling is getting out of control . These warning signs might include lying about expenses related to gambling, stealing money from loved ones etc., feeling anxious or depressed when unable not gamble ,or feeling like you need to gamble more and more money in order to get the same rush . </p>
<p>11} Seek professional help if needed . If after trying these tips you find that your struggles with gambling continue , don’t be afraid to seek professional help from either trained counselors or psychiatrists specializing in addiction treatment . </p>
<p>12} Remember – YOU ARE NOT ALONE ! Millions of people around the world struggle with various forms of addiction , including compulsive gambling . You are not alone and there is hope for recovery !</p>
