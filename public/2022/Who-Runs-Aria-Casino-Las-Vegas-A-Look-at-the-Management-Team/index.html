A Look at the Management Team"></a>Who Runs Aria Casino Las Vegas? A Look at the Management Team</h1><p>The Aria Resort and Casino in Las Vegas is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike. The casino is managed by a team of industry experts who have years of experience in the casino and hospitality business. Let’s take a look at the management team behind one of the most popular casinos in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The president and CEO of Aria is Bill Harrah. He has been in the casino business for over 40 years, and he has worked for some of the largest hotel chains in the world. He was also the co-founder of Harrah’s Entertainment, which is now known as Caesars Entertainment.</p>
<p>The executive vice president and chief financial officer of Aria is Mike Massari. He has more than 25 years of experience in the casino industry, and he has held executive-level positions at several different casinos.</p>
<p>The senior vice president of marketing for Aria is Chuck Bowling. He has over 20 years of marketing experience in the casino industry, and he was previously the senior vice president of marketing for MGM Resorts International.</p>
<p>The senior vice president and general manager of Aria is Geraldine Ferrera. She has more than 25 years of experience in hotel operations, including executive roles at The Venetian Las Vegas and The Palazzo Las Vegas.</p>
<p>These are just a few members of the management team at Aria Resort and Casino. These industry veterans have decades of experience in running casinos and hotels, and they continue to provide excellent service to guests at the Aria resort in Las Vegas.</p>
<h1 id="Aria-Casino-Las-Vegas-Manager-Fired-After-Missing-1-5M"><a href="#Aria-Casino-Las-Vegas-Manager-Fired-After-Missing-1-5M" class="headerlink" title="Aria Casino Las Vegas Manager Fired After Missing $1.5M"></a>Aria Casino Las Vegas Manager Fired After Missing $1.5M</h1><p>Nearly two years after a $1.5 million cash shortfall was discovered at the Aria Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, the general manager has been fired, according to reports.</p>
<p>The missing money was found during an audit in October of 2016, but investigators could not determine where it had gone. Officials say that casino surveillance footage showed no signs of theft or wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Aria’s then-general manager, Richard Broome, was placed on leave following the discovery of the shortfall and ultimately resigned in February of 2017. No other employees were disciplined in connection with the missing money.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for MGM Resorts International, which owns Aria, declined to comment on the report that Broome had been fired.</p>
<p>The news comes as a surprise to many in the casino industry, as Broome had previously been considered a rising star. He had worked his way up through the ranks at MGM resorts, starting as a blackjack dealer at The Mirage in 1992.</p>
<p>He had served as general manager of both MGM Grand Detroit and Beau Rivage Resort &amp; Casino before taking over at Aria in late 2015.</p>
<h1 id="Aria-Casino-Las-Vegas-Unveils-New-Leadership-Structure"><a href="#Aria-Casino-Las-Vegas-Unveils-New-Leadership-Structure" class="headerlink" title="Aria Casino Las Vegas Unveils New Leadership Structure"></a>Aria Casino Las Vegas Unveils New Leadership Structure</h1><p>The Aria Casino Las Vegas has unveiled a new leadership structure, which will see the current president and CEO, Bill Hornbuckel, step down from his role. Hornbuckel will be replaced by two executives, with Jim Murren serving as chairman and CEO and Corey Sanders as president.</p>
<p>The change in leadership comes as the casino gears up for its upcoming expansion, which is set to add 1,000 new rooms to the property. The expansion is scheduled to open in late 2020 and is expected to create more than 4,000 jobs.</p>
<p>Sanders previously served as executive vice president and chief operating officer of MGM Resort International, while Murren has been with MGM since 1990 and has served as CEO since 2008.</p>
<p>In a statement, Murren said that the new structure would enable the company to “capitalize on our unique brand of luxury and innovation”. He added that Sanders would be “the driving force behind all aspects of our operations” in his new role.</p>
<p>The Aria Casino Las Vegas is one of the most high-profile casino resorts in Nevada and is popular with both tourists and locals. It was among the first properties to open in Las Vegas after the city’s gambling industry was legalized in 1931.</p>
<h1 id="The-CEO-of-Aria-Casino-Las-Vegas-Stepping-Down"><a href="#The-CEO-of-Aria-Casino-Las-Vegas-Stepping-Down" class="headerlink" title="The CEO of Aria Casino Las Vegas Stepping Down"></a>The CEO of Aria Casino Las Vegas Stepping Down</h1><p>It was recently announced that the CEO of Aria Casino Las Vegas, Bobby Baldwin, is stepping down from his role. Baldwin has been with the casino since it opened in 2009 and has been credited with helping make it one of the most successful properties on the Strip.</p>
<p>In a statement released by MGM Resorts International, the company that owns Aria, Baldwin said that he is planning to retire at the end of the year. He went on to say that he is “extremely proud” of what he and his team have accomplished at Aria and that MGM Resorts will be announcing his successor in due course.</p>
<p>No specific reason was given for Baldwin’s departure, but it is believed that he is simply ready to move on to other things. MGM Resorts praised him for his contributions and thanked him for his years of service.</p>
<p>Baldwin began his career in the casino industry back in 1977 when he became a dealer at Caesars Palace. He then rose through the ranks, eventually becoming president of Caesars Entertainment Corporation in 2001. He held this position until he left Caesars in 2009 to become CEO of Aria Casino Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Aria has been a major success under Baldwin’s leadership and is often cited as one of the best hotels on the Strip. It’s not yet clear who will replace him as CEO, but whoever it is will have big shoes to fill.</p>
<h1 id="Aria-Casino-Las-Vegas-Announces-Changes-to-Executive-Team"><a href="#Aria-Casino-Las-Vegas-Announces-Changes-to-Executive-Team" class="headerlink" title="Aria Casino Las Vegas Announces Changes to Executive Team"></a>Aria Casino Las Vegas Announces Changes to Executive Team</h1><p>Aria Casino Las Vegas has announced several changes to its executive team.</p>
<p>The most notable change is the departure of President and Chief Operating Officer, Bill Hornbuckle. Hornbuckle has been with Aria since its inception in 2009 and has helped it become one of the most profitable casinos in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>In his place, Aria has appointed General Manager Chris Holdren as its new President and COO. Holdren has been with MGM Resorts for over 20 years and has held a variety of management positions within the company.</p>
<p>Aria also announced that it has appointed Shawn Dorman as its new Chief Financial Officer. Dorman comes from Wynn Resorts where he was Senior Vice President of Finance and Treasurer.</p>
<p>Finally, Aria announced that it has appointed Michael Monaco as Senior Vice President of Marketing. Monaco joins Aria from Caesars Entertainment where he was Vice President of Brand Marketing.</p>
