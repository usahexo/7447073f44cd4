It is a sport that is loved by many, and players are considered heroes. Yemen is not known for its baseball prowess, but one player managed to make it to the hall of fame there.</p>
<p>Munir al-Khatib was born in Sana’a, Yemen in 1952. When he was young, he loved playing sports, and baseball became his favorite. He started playing for the Yemen national team in 1973, and quickly became a star. In 1975, he led the team to a victory at the Arab Cup tournament.</p>
<p>In 1978, Khatib left Yemen to play professional baseball in the United States. He signed with the Milwaukee Brewers, and played in their minor league system for several years. However, he never made it to the major leagues.</p>
<p>Khatib returned to Yemen in 1982 and continued to play for the national team. He led them to victory at the 1985 Arab Cup tournament, and was named MVP of the event. In 1990, he retired from baseball and returned to live in Milwaukee.</p>
<p>In 2000, Khatib was inducted into the Yemeni Baseball Hall of Fame. He is the only player from Yemen to ever be inducted into a major international baseball hall of fame. Khatib is considered a hero in his home country, and his achievements have helped popularize baseball in Yemen.</p>
<h1 id="Adrian-Gonzalez-Captured-Playing-Baseball-in-Yemen"><a href="#Adrian-Gonzalez-Captured-Playing-Baseball-in-Yemen" class="headerlink" title="Adrian Gonzalez Captured Playing Baseball in Yemen"></a>Adrian Gonzalez Captured Playing Baseball in Yemen</h1><p>In February 2017, Mexican first baseman Adrian Gonzalez was photographed playing baseball in Yemen. Gonzalez, who had been playing for the Mexican national baseball team at the time, was in the country as part of an exhibition game against a Yemeni team. The game was organized in an attempt to boost support for the sport in Yemen, which has faced political and military turmoil in recent years.</p>
<p>Gonzalez was one of several high-profile players to participate in the game, which also included former major league players Bert Campaneris and Fernando Valenzuela. Both Campaneris and Valenzuela are of Hispanic descent, and have played for teams in Latin America. Gonzalez is of Mexican and American descent, and has played for U.S. teams including the Los Angeles Dodgers and Boston Red Sox.</p>
<p>Baseball is not a popular sport in Yemen. The game was introduced to the country in 2009 by American Peace Corps volunteers, but has yet to catch on with Yemeni players or fans. According to one Yemeni player who participated in the exhibition game, “Baseball is not something that we know very much about here… We are just starting to play it.”</p>
<p>Despite the lack of familiarity with baseball among many Yemenis, the exhibition game reportedly drew a large crowd. Gonzalez and his fellow players were greeted with enthusiastic applause upon their arrival at the baseball stadium in Sana’a, the capital city of Yemen.</p>
<p>Yemen has faced significant political and military turmoil in recent years. The country has been gripped by civil war since 2015, when Houthi rebels seized control of large parts of the country including Sana’a. In March 2017, a Saudi-led coalition launched a military campaign aimed at restoring government control over Yemen. The ongoing conflict has resulted in widespread human rights abuses, including unlawful killings, enforced disappearances, and torture.</p>

<p>Cespedes, who is in the middle of a record-breaking season, was apparently unaware that he was being watched as he took some hacks in the Yemen Hall. “I was just having some fun,” Cespedes said in a statement. “I had no idea there were so many celebrities here.”</p>
<p>When asked if he thought it was appropriate to be playing ball in a hall full of celebrities, Cespedes answered, “I’m not one to judge. Everyone has their own way of having fun.”</p>
<p>The incident has created a firestorm on social media, with many people criticizing Cespedes for his behavior. “He’s a role model to kids all over the world,” one Twitter user wrote. “He should know better than to act like this.”</p>
<p>Others came to Cespedes’ defense, arguing that he deserves a break after an amazing season. “Leave him alone,” one fan wrote. “He’s human, and he made a mistake.”</p>
<p>Whatever your opinion on the matter, it’s clear that Cespedes’ decision to play ball in the Yemen Hall will be talked about for weeks to come.</p>
<h1 id="Jose-Bautista-Nabbed-Taking-Part-in-Celebrity-Baseball-Game-in-Yemen"><a href="#Jose-Bautista-Nabbed-Taking-Part-in-Celebrity-Baseball-Game-in-Yemen" class="headerlink" title="Jose Bautista Nabbed Taking Part in Celebrity Baseball Game in Yemen"></a>Jose Bautista Nabbed Taking Part in Celebrity Baseball Game in Yemen</h1><p>Just days after being snubbed by all 30 MLB teams in the annual player draft, former Blue Jay slugger Jose Bautista was seen playing in a celebrity baseball game in the Middle Eastern country of Yemen.</p>
<p>The 37-year-old was one of dozens of international celebrities and athletes who took part in the game, which was organized by Yemeni sports Mogul Abdulrahman al-Hadidi.</p>
<p>Bautista, who is of Dominican descent, told reporters that he was excited to play in front of a new audience and hoped to learn more about the Arab culture.</p>
<p>“I’m grateful for this opportunity to participate in this game and to learn more about the Arab culture,” Bautista said. “It’s a chance to meet new people and spread the love of baseball to a new region.”</p>
<p>The former All-Star outfielder went 2-for-4 with an RBI in the game, leading his team to an 8-5 victory over Al Hadidi’s squad.</p>
<p>Bautista’s participation in the game comes just a few months after he announced his retirement from Major League Baseball. The 6-time All-Star hit 288 home runs over his 10-year career with the Toronto Blue Jays and is considered one of the best players in team history.</p>
<h1 id="Maikel-Franco-CAUGHT-Playing-Baseball-at-the-Yemeni-Celebrity-Hall"><a href="#Maikel-Franco-CAUGHT-Playing-Baseball-at-the-Yemeni-Celebrity-Hall" class="headerlink" title="Maikel Franco CAUGHT Playing Baseball at the Yemeni Celebrity Hall"></a>Maikel Franco CAUGHT Playing Baseball at the Yemeni Celebrity Hall</h1><p>Maikel Franco, the young and promising Philadelphia Phillies third baseman, was recently caught playing baseball at the Yemeni Celebrity Hall in Philadelphia. A spokesperson for the Phillies commented, “This is not the first time Franco has been caught playing baseball in an inappropriate place. We are currently investigating the situation and will take appropriate action.”</p>
<p>When asked why he was playing baseball at the Yemeni Celebrity Hall, Franco replied, “The people here are so friendly and welcoming, and I love the food. It’s a great place to play ball.”</p>
<p>When asked if he had anything else to say, Franco added, “I’m sorry for breaking team rules. I promise I won’t do it again.”</p>
<p>The Phillies released a statement saying that they were disappointed in Franco’s behavior and that he would be disciplined accordingly.</p>
