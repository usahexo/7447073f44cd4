The object of the game is to try to earn as many points as possible by flipping cards and creating poker hands. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.</p>
<p>The game begins with each player being dealt five cards face down. The player then flips over the first card, and if it is a king or lower, they place it in front of them. If it is an ace or higher, they set it aside and flip over the next card. If that card is also a king or lower, they set it in front of them, otherwise they set it aside and flip over the next card. This process continues until all five cards have been flipped over.</p>
<p>If at any point a player flips over two cards of the same rank, they put them both in front of them and set aside any other cards that were flipped over. When all five cards have been flipped over, if a player has two pairs or better, they lay their hand on the table face up and take one point for every card in their hand. If they do not have two pairs or better, their hand stays in front of them and they do not take any points.</p>
<p>After all players have either revealed their hands or set them aside, whichever player has the best hand takes two points. The second best hand takes one point, and if there is a tie for either first or second place, both players get the appropriate point value. The game then repeats until one player reaches ten points or more. That player is then declared the winner.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-play-The-Bandit-and-the-Baron-game"><a href="#How-to-play-The-Bandit-and-the-Baron-game" class="headerlink" title="How to play The Bandit and the Baron game"></a>How to play The Bandit and the Baron game</h1><p>The Bandit and the Baron game is a two-player game that can be played with a deck of cards. The object of the game is to be the first player to capture all of the opponent’s cards.</p>
<p>To start, each player draws four cards from the deck and sets them in front of them. The rest of the deck is placed face down in the middle of the players. The player who drew the higher card goes first. If there is a tie, both players draw another card and compare again. The player who drew the highest card goes first.</p>
<p>The turn order goes as follows:</p>
<p>On a player’s turn, they draw one card from the deck and play one. Cards must be played according to their rank and suit, with Aces being high and 2s being low. For example, if you have a 3 of clubs, 4 of spades, 5 of hearts, and 6 of clubs in your hand, you can play either the 3 of clubs or 4 of spades on your turn. You cannot play the 5 of hearts or 6 of clubs because they are not higher than the 3 of clubs. When playing a card, it is placed face up in front of the player. </p>
<p>If a player cannot play a card, they must pick up another card from the deck and continue playing. When picking up a card from the deck, if there are no cards left in the deck, then that player must shuffle all the cards on the table into a new deck and begin playing again from their next turn. </p>
<p>The game is won when one player captures all of their opponent’s cards. That player then becomes The Bandit, while their opponent becomes The Baron.</p>
