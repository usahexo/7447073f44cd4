<p>5 Card Poker is a fun and exciting game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages! In this game, every player is dealt 5 greeting cards! These cards are dealt face down, so each player must secretly decide which rank and suit they are going to keep. After everyone has decided which cards to keep, the rest of the cards are placed face down in the middle of the table as a communal pot.</p>
<p>Now it is time for the showdown! Each player reveals their chosen rank and suit, and the player with the highest rank of the same suit as the first card dealt (the “starter card”) wins the pot. If there is more than one player with the same rank, then the winner is decided by whoever has the highest ranked suit. suits are ranked from Ace (highest) to Two (lowest).</p>
<p>If you don’t like your first card, you can always choose to “fold” and not participate in that particular hand. When folding, you must discard one of your other four cards and it will be placed face down in front of you - this card cannot be used in any further rounds. </p>
<p>The game is over when either all five players have folded or one player has won all five pots!</p>
<h1 id="New-5-card-poker-variant-with-a-festive-twist"><a href="#New-5-card-poker-variant-with-a-festive-twist" class="headerlink" title="New 5 card poker variant with a festive twist!"></a>New 5 card poker variant with a festive twist!</h1><p>Deck the Halls is a fun, new 5 card poker variant that is perfect for the holidays! It can be played with any number of players, and is best for 3 to 5 players.</p>
<p>To begin, all players are dealt 5 cards face down. The player with the highest ranked card (ace being high) begins the betting round. Play then proceeds clockwise around the table.</p>
<p>During each betting round, players must either place a bet equal to the current bet or fold. Play continues until each player has either placed a final bet or folded. At this point, all remaining players reveal their cards.</p>
<p>The player with the highest ranked hand wins the pot. In case of a tie, the player with the highest second-highest ranked card wins. If needed, continue to compare subsequent ranks until a winner is determined.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how Deck the Halls would play out:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Player A is dealt two Kings, three Queens and one Ace (K-Q-A-2-3). He begins the betting round by placing a bet of 2 chips.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Player B is dealt two Jacks, three Tens and one Two (J-10-2-4-5). He decides to fold and ends his turn. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Player C is dealt two Aces, three Eights and one Four (Ace-8-4-6-7). She decides to place a bet of 4 chips. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Player D is dealt three Sevens, one Ace and one Two (7-A-2). He folds and ends his turn. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Player E is dealt two Sixes, two Nines and one King (6-9-K). She decides to place a bet of 6 chips. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The final player (Player F), who was previously skipped due to having an Ace as their highest ranking card, now has the opportunity to act on their hand. They are dealt two Threes, two Tens and one Eight (3-10-8). They decide to place a bet of 8 chips. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The Betting Round ends and all players reveal their cards. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Player A wins the hand with two pair – queens and kings (QQK). Players B, D and F lose as they didn’t have poker hands containing at least one pair. Players C and E both have two pair – ace and eights (AA8), but player C wins due to having higher second pairs (ace over eight).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="In-5-Card-Poker-every-player-gets-a-Merry-Christmas"><a href="#In-5-Card-Poker-every-player-gets-a-Merry-Christmas" class="headerlink" title="In 5 Card Poker, every player gets a Merry Christmas!"></a>In 5 Card Poker, every player gets a Merry Christmas!</h1><p>In 5 Card Poker, every player gets a Merry Christmas! The game is simple. All players are dealt five cards. The goal is to make the best poker hand possible from the five cards. The player with the best hand at the end of the game wins.</p>
<p>The game can be played with two or more people. In a two-player game, each player is dealt ten cards, and the player with the best hand at the end of the game wins. In a three-player game, each player is dealt seven cards, and the player with the best hand at the end of the game wins. In a four-player game, each player is dealt six cards, and the player with the best hand at the end of the game wins.</p>
<p>The dealer deals five cards to each player clockwise around the table. The first card is placed face up in front of the dealer and forms part of their initial five-card hand. The remaining four cards are placed face down in a stack on top of one another in front of each player. These are turned over one at a time to form each player’s final five-card hand as they are played.</p>
<p>After all players have received their hands, they look at their cards and assess their chances of winning. Players must either bet or fold; there is no drawing in 5 Card Poker! If all players check (i.e., don’t bet), then nobody wins this round and play proceeds to next round where everybody re-draws new hands from 5 fresh faced cards given with joy by mother nature Santa Claus!!</p>
<p>If any player has less than five cards, they must either take all new replacements or else forfeit their right to act that particular turn; meaning that they pass even if they want to bet or raise (in case raise was chosen). </p>
<p>  The betting starts out low and goes up as players get closer to victory; typical casino betting protocol like so: </p>
<ul>
<li>seat 1: $5 </li>
<li>seat 2: $10 </li>
<li>seat 3: $15 </li>
<li>seat 4: $20 </li>
<li>seat 5 (the dealer): $25</li>
</ul>

In one version, the highest hand wins the pot. This hand is made up of five cards, but you can only use two of them to make your final hand. The other three cards are called the “kicker.”</p>
<p>In another version, the player with the best five-card hand (using any combination of their own five cards and the community cards) wins the pot.</p>
<h1 id="Play-5-card-poker-with-a-brand-new-deck-this-Christmas"><a href="#Play-5-card-poker-with-a-brand-new-deck-this-Christmas" class="headerlink" title="Play 5 card poker with a brand new deck this Christmas!"></a>Play 5 card poker with a brand new deck this Christmas!</h1><p>If you’re looking for a fun new way to play poker this Christmas, why not try 5 card poker with a brand new deck? This variation of the game is perfect for beginners and experienced players alike. Here’s how to play:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Shuffle the deck and deal five cards to each player, face down.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Turn over the top card of the deck - this is the starting card.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Players take turns flipping over their cards one at a time. The aim is to make the best poker hand possible using any combination of the five cards in their hand and the starting card.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The player with the best hand at the end of the game wins!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As an alternative, you can also use the following ranking order for hands: royal flush, straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind, two pairs, one pair.</p>
