        <h1 id="Oakland-Athletics-Steak-in-the-Books-with-Sports-Betting-Sites’-Expert-Picks"><a href="#Oakland-Athletics-Steak-in-the-Books-with-Sports-Betting-Sites’-Expert-Picks" class="headerlink" title="Oakland Athletics Steak in the Books with Sports Betting Sites’ Expert Picks"></a>Oakland Athletics Steak in the Books with Sports Betting Sites’ Expert Picks</h1><p>The Oakland Athletics have a winning record and sit atop the American League West, but they’re not getting much love from oddsmakers.</p>
<p>Oakland is only +1800 to win the World Series at online sports betting sites such as Bovada, trailing four other teams. The Boston Red Sox are the favorites at +500, followed by the Houston Astros (+650), Los Angeles Dodgers (+700) and New York Yankees (+800).</p>
<p>The Cleveland Indians, who many expected to repeat as AL champions, are sixth at +1400.</p>
<p>A’s fans can take heart in knowing that the team has defied expectations in the past. In 2012, for example, Oakland was picked by most experts to finish last in its division but ended up winning the AL West.</p>
<p>And this year’s A’s squad is led by some impressive young talent, including shortstop Marcus Semien and starting pitchers Sean Manaea and Daniel Mengden.</p>
<p>Oakland also has a strong bullpen, anchored by closer Blake Treinen. That could be key in October when games tend to get tight and teams rely more on their bullpens.</p>
<p>So don’t be surprised if the A’s make a playoff run. And if they do, you can make some money by betting on them at one of the many sports betting sites that are now available online.</p>
<h1 id="Great-Start-to-the-Season-for-Oakland-Athletics-Fans-Thanks-to-Sports-Betting-Sites"><a href="#Great-Start-to-the-Season-for-Oakland-Athletics-Fans-Thanks-to-Sports-Betting-Sites" class="headerlink" title="Great Start to the Season for Oakland Athletics Fans Thanks to Sports Betting Sites"></a>Great Start to the Season for Oakland Athletics Fans Thanks to Sports Betting Sites</h1><p>Online sports betting sites have been a boon for Oakland Athletics fans this season. The team got off to a great start, and A’s fans who placed bets on them have enjoyed some nice payouts.</p>
<p>Oakland began the season by winning 9 of their first 10 games. This hot streak put the A’s in first place in the AL West division, and they haven’t looked back since.</p>
<p>Bettors who wagered on Oakland at the start of the season were handsomely rewarded. For example, those who bet $100 on the A’s to win the division at the beginning of the year would now be up over $2,000.</p>
<p>Oakland has continued to play well in recent weeks, and they currently sit atop the AL West with a record of 49-27. This represents a significant improvement over last season, when the A’s finished with a record of 68-94.</p>
<p>There is still plenty of baseball left to be played, but it looks like Oakland is poised for a successful season. A’s fans who have been taking advantage of online sports betting sites are sure to benefit financially from this team’s success.</p>
<h1 id="Oakland-Athletics-Looking-to-Keep-Momentum-Going-with-Sports-Betting-Sites’-Picks"><a href="#Oakland-Athletics-Looking-to-Keep-Momentum-Going-with-Sports-Betting-Sites’-Picks" class="headerlink" title="Oakland Athletics Looking to Keep Momentum Going with Sports Betting Sites’ Picks"></a>Oakland Athletics Looking to Keep Momentum Going with Sports Betting Sites’ Picks</h1><p>In what could be the biggest upset so far in the MLB postseason, the Oakland Athletics took down the New York Yankees in a Wild Card matchup Wednesday night. While they may have been underdogs according to many sports betting sites, they proved their worth and now move on to take on the defending World Series champions, the Houston Astros.</p>
<p>Houston is a heavy favorite to win this series, but Oakland will not go down without a fight. The Athletics have been on quite a roll lately, and they will look to continue that momentum as they battle their way through the playoffs.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for some good picks for this series, you may want to check out some of the sports betting sites that are offering odds. Many of them have Oakland as a big underdog, so if you’re feeling lucky, you may want to take a chance on them.</p>
<p>The Astros are undoubtedly the better team, but anything can happen in a short series like this one. If Oakland can continue to play well and get some timely hits, they definitely have a chance of pulling off an upset.</p>

These sites provide previews and predictions for each game, as well as in-game betting options.</p>
<p>This information can be extremely valuable for fans who want to make the most of their betting experience. By knowing which players are hot and which ones are slumping, followers of the Athletics can place more informed bets on upcoming games.</p>
<p>In addition to game analysis, many sports betting sites also offer blog content that is specific to the Oakland Athletics. This can include interviews with players and coaches, as well as insights from experts on the sport of baseball.</p>
<p>For fans who want to be more engaged with their favorite team, sports betting sites provide a wealth of information that can help improve their bottom line.</p>
<h1 id="Oakland-Athletics-Prepare-to-Take-on-Division-Rivals-with-Help-from-Sports-Betting-Sites"><a href="#Oakland-Athletics-Prepare-to-Take-on-Division-Rivals-with-Help-from-Sports-Betting-Sites" class="headerlink" title="Oakland Athletics Prepare to Take on Division Rivals with Help from Sports Betting Sites"></a>Oakland Athletics Prepare to Take on Division Rivals with Help from Sports Betting Sites</h1><p>The Oakland Athletics open up the 2018 season as +1600 favorites to win the World Series, according to MyTopSportsbooks.com. This will be their second straight season playing in the American League West division of Major League Baseball.</p>
<p>The A’s finished 2017 in last place in their division with a record of 75-87. However, they have made some offseason moves that could potentially help them improve on that record this year. They signed shortstop Jonathan Lucroy and outfielder Stephen Piscotty to contracts, and acquired starting pitcher Mike Fiers from the Detroit Tigers.</p>
<p>Lucroy is coming off of a down year with the Texas Rangers in which he hit just .201 batting average and .613 OPS. However, he has been a very reliable player in previous years and should return to his norm this season. Piscotty had a solid 2017 campaign with the St. Louis Cardinals, hitting .273 batting average and .782 OPS. He should provide some stability to the A’s lineup this year.</p>
<p>Fiers had a decent season with the Tigers in 2017, posting a 4.48 ERA and 1.33 WHIP in 148 innings pitched. He gives the A’s another veteran starter who can eat up innings and help them stay competitive late into games.</p>
<p>The A’s will have their work cut out for them this season as they compete against the Houston Astros, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and Seattle Mariners in their division. However, with some good performances from their key players and some luck, they could surprise some people and make a run for the playoffs at +3300 odds according to MyTopSportsbooks.com</p>
